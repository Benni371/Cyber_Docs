## Benefits of the Cloud
- Scaling is key to why the cloud is useful
- API-driven 
- Regions contain availability zones usually 3 or 4. 
	- availability zones are data centers and provide redundancy for most AWS products
- More expensive?
	- it does cost more BUT you dont have to buy it, track lifecycle, interact with the hardware
- Software is more flexible and can change more quickly, easily and cost-effectively
- capital cost vs variable cost
	- capital is you pay no matter what (traditional DC) 
	- variable is you can adjust for what you actually use
- Stop guessing capacity needs. No overestimating server capacity and scaling is quick and easy
- Go global in minutes
## Products
### IAM
- An account is boundary for any resource or user. A user in one account will not exist in another account.
- AWS organizations allows for one account to govern all other accounts
## Pricing
- Compute, Storage, and Data Transfer
- Pay less by using more
- Reserved Instances are available in AURI, NURI, and PURI
	- to receive the discounted rate associated with reserved instances, you do not need to make a full, upfront payment
- The four support plans offered by aws support are basic, developer, business, and enterprise
