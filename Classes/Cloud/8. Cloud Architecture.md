## Cloud Architecture
- Operational Excellence Design Principles
	- perform ops as code
	- annotate docs
	- make small revs changes
	- refine ops procs freq
	- anticipate failure
	- learn from all op events and failures
	- Questions:
		- Organization
		- operate
		- prepare
		- evolve
- Security Design Principles
	- implement strong ident found
	- enable trace
	- apply sec at all layers
	- automate sec best practices
	- protect data in transit and at res
	- keep people away from data
	- prepare for security events
	- Questions
		- Security
		- IAM
		- Detection
		- Infra protection
		- data protection
- Reliability
	- Test recovery procs
	- automatically recover from failure
	- scale horizontally to increase aggregate system availability
	- stop guessing capacity
	- manage change in automation
	- questions:
		- foundations
		- workload architecture
		- change management
		- failure management
- Performance Efficiency Pillar
	- Democratize adv techs
	- go global in mins
	- use serverless archs
	- experiment more often
	- have mechanical sympathy
	- Questions
		- Selection
		- review
		- monitoring
		- tradeoffs
- Cost Optimization
	- Adopt a consumption model
	- measure overall efficiency
	- stop spending money on data center ops
	- analyze and attribute expenditure
	- use managed and application-level services to reduce cost of ownership
	- Questions:
		- Practice cloud financial management
		- Expenditure and usage awareness
		- cost effective resources
		- manage demand and supply resources
		- optimize over time
- AWS Trusted Advisor too
	- looks at aws and gives recommendations in:
		- cost optimization
		- performance
		- security
		- fault tolerance
		- service limits
