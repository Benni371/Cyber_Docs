	- refine ops procs freq
	- anticipate failure
	- learn from all op events and failures
- Security Design Principles
	- implement strong ident found
	- enable trace
	- apply sec at all layers
	- automate sec best practices
	- protect data in transit and at res
	- keep people away from data
	- prepare for security events
- Reliability
	- Test recovery procs
	- automatically recover from failure
	- scale horizontally to increase aggregate system availability
	- stop guessing capacity
	- manage change in automation
- Performance Efficiency Pillar
	- Democratize adv techs
	- go global in mins
	- use serverless archs
	- experiment more often
	- have mechanical
