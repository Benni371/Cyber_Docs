# EBS (Elastic Block Store)

## General
- File System Vs Object Store
	- FS supports hierarchy's, attributes, and permissions
	- S3 (object store) gives the appearance of directories but its an illusion it is actually a flat file system
		- names have to be unique
		- every bucket has a region but the namespace is global
## S3
- S3 is private by default
- must be unique worldwide across all AWS accounts
- A vault is a container for storing archives
- S3 buckets are crated in a specific aws region
- S3 replicates all objects in multiple availability zones within the same region
## EBS
- Volumes contain a filesystem
	- easy to backup
- recommended when data must be easily accessible and encrypted
- data persists when he instance is stopped and the data is automatically replicated within an availability zone.
## EFS (Elastic File System)
- EFS works like a file share and can be attached to multiple places

- generally faster than S3
	- S3 is API driven so limited by internet
	- EFS is like CIFS/SMB over LAN
	- EBS is like local filesystem (fastest)
	- Instance Store is like PCIe
