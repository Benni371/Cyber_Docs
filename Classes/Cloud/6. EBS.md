## General
- File System Vs Object Store
	- FS supports hierachys, attributes, and permissions
	- S3 (object store) gives the appearance of directories but its an illusion it is actually a flat file system
		- names have to be unique
		- every bucket has a region but the namespace is global
		- 
## EBS
- Volumes contain a filesystem
	- easy to backup
## EFS (Elastic File System)
- EFS works like a file share and can be attached to multiple places
- recommended when data
- generally faster than S3
	- S3 is API driven so limited by internet
	- EFS is like CIFS/SMB over LAN
	- EBS is like local filesystem (fastest)
	- Instance Store is like PCIe
