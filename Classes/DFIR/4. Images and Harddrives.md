## General
- Slack space is the space left in a cluster. Basically a half-used cluster
- FAT = File Allocation Table
## Images and Hard Drives
- Hard drives consist of multiple discs separated into sectors (slice of pie) and cluster (the tracks that run across the slice)
	- hard drives have tiny little particles that are ionized (have a negative and positive end). The needle writes data by charging and discharging these particles
