## General
- Slack space is the space left in a cluster. Basically a half-used cluster
- FAT = File Allocation Table
- MFT holds index records for files and folders stored on the disk
	- each MFT entry is 1024 bytes
	- almost always installed on the same drive as the OS and indexes even the files on other drives
	- Every file on the hard drive consists of 3 parts filename layer, metadata layer, and data layer
		- the filename and metadata layers exist in the MFT; data layers is the location on the drive
	- Timestampts
		- Modified
		- Accessed
		- Changed (last time the files MFT entry was modified; not too important for DFIR)
			- may also stand for what is on the disk
		- Birth
	- Unallocated Space
		- 22nd bit on the header denotes several thigns
			- 0x00 not in use
			- 0x01 in use
			- 0x02 is a directory
			- 0x03 directory in use
			- 0x04 record is extension from another record
			- 0x08 special index
## Images and Hard Drives
- Hard drives consist of multiple discs separated into sectors (slice of pie) and cluster (the tracks that run across the slice)
	- hard drives have tiny little particles that are ionized (have a negative and positive end). The needle writes data by charging and discharging these particles
