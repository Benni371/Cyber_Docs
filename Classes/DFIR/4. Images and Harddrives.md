## General
- Slack space is the space left in a cluster. Basically a half-used cluster
- FAT = File Allocation Table
- MFT holds index records for files and folders stored on the disk
	- each MFT entry is 1024 bytes
	- almost always installed on the same drive as the OS and indexes even the files on other drives
## Images and Hard Drives
- Hard drives consist of multiple discs separated into sectors (slice of pie) and cluster (the tracks that run across the slice)
	- hard drives have tiny little particles that are ionized (have a negative and positive end). The needle writes data by charging and discharging these particles
