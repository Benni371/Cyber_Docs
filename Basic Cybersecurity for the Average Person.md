# Introduction

By the time you are reading this is it is probably too late. The majority of your information is already publicly available on the internet in some shape or form. Unfortunately when the Internet boom happened, privacy was the least of any persons concern (mine included). To be fair, its hard to imagine that 15-20 years from the time we all created our Facebook, MSN, or Twitter accounts that our information would be so easily accessible. Birthdays, Social Security Numbers, House Purchases, Credit Card Numbers, Home Addresses; Many of these pieces of personal information are readily available, and some are shockingly easy to obtain. Fortunately, over the past years a lot of this data has become less available to the public but it may still exist in places where government regulation cannot reach. This guide is aimed to help increase your personal cybersecurity posture and is not an end-all and be-all type of document. This guide gives you basic knowledge that can help you protect yourself from the dangers that you may not know about or dangers that you do know about but don't know what to do about.
## Protecting Your Information

Most of your personal information is out there on the internet. It could be family photos from your vacation that you posted to your Facebook back in 2010 or it could be your home address that was in a resume that you sent out to who knows where when you were applying for jobs. Needless to say, stuff you may not want out there may be out there. Want a funny story on how a foodstagrammer got a food bill for food they didnt order due to a simple picture post?

### Just Because Someone Requests Something, Doesnt Mean You Have to Give it to Them

  

**TL;DR:**  

Be cautious with sharing personal information like SSNs, home addresses, and birth dates. Question why it's needed, especially in non-contract situations. You control your data; ask for deletion when possible, as mishandled info can lead to identity theft or privacy breaches. Some states allow you to request deletion under "right to erasure" or "right to be forgotten" laws.

  

<p>Even today we as a society are too generous with our information. To illustrate this, I'll tell a quick story. I remember we applied to an apartment complex when my wife and I first got married. On the application it had us fill out the regular details (names, current housing, current job and salary) but then, it asked us for our social security numbers. Now most people wouldnt bat an eye and just put this in. But heres the thing, if its an application, not even a contract, why do they need my SSN? Our prospective landlord was a sweet elderly woman so I doubt she had ill-intentions but still it shouldnt have been on there. We politely declined to put our SSNs in and mentioned that we would be willing to put it on an official contract if we were approved to rent. And you know what? They respected that, approved us to rent and we gave them the information for the contract. In some situations its not possible to deny this information but it never hurts to ask why they may need it or what they do with that information. This is YOUR information. You can decide who and where it goes to.</p>

<p>Information like SSN, Drivers License Numbers, Home Addresses, Birth Dates and similar items are what is called Personally Identifiable Information. These items should be guarded and not freely given out. Lets say in my example we did give them our SSN's and we were later denied to rent the apartment. I have no control over what that person does with that information. Is that person responsible with that information and shreds it afterwards? Or do they leave it around their house or throw it away where some passerby may happen upon that information. It might sound ludicrous but trust me it has happened.</p>

  

Lastly, try to keep track of who you give out this information to. If you dont want your previous landlord to have your information you can request that they delete it upon the expiration of your contract. In many states there is a law enabling consumers to request the deletion of their personal data. Some states call it the "right to erasure" or the "right to be forgotten". Most companies and businesses will comply with this but there are some circumstances where it is not possible for legality reasons.
